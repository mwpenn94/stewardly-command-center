The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Dashboard AI Quick Insights** — Health score indicator with color-coded status, top 3 prioritized recommendations with priority badges and actionable navigation links, auto-refreshes every 5 minutes. Surfaces the most important AI intelligence directly on the command center home page

### Fixed
- **Contact detail dialog mobile** — Explicit responsive max-width with `calc(100%-2rem)` base and 90vh max-height for better mobile viewing
- **Mutation error handling** — All 8 mutations that were missing `onError` handlers now show toast errors (Contacts CRUD, Campaign delete/template/cancel, SyncEngine retry/stop, BulkImport create)
- **Double-click protection** — Delete contact, delete campaign, and retry DLQ buttons now disabled during pending state with loading spinners
- **Safe JSON.parse** — Contacts tags and Campaign metrics parsing wrapped in try/catch to prevent component crashes on malformed data
- **Documentation accuracy** — All doc files updated with correct counts: 73 tRPC procedures, 11 database tables, accurate line counts

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Mobile touch targets** — Campaign delete/launch/cancel buttons, Flow Builder reorder/remove/channel-add buttons, and Integrations password toggle all now meet 44px minimum touch target size (were 28px)
- **Campaign dialog widths** — All 5 dialogs (Create, Launch, Sequence, Template, Channel Config) now use responsive `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)] sm:max-w-*` pattern instead of fixed widths that overflowed on mobile
- **Dashboard omnichannel grid** — Added 2-column layout for screens under 400px; was forcing 3 columns on tiny screens causing cramped cards
- **Backups Platform Data Mirror** — Previously hardcoded with static platform names; now wired to real `trpc.orchestrator.platformHealth` and `trpc.contacts.stats` showing live connected/disconnected status, last-checked timestamps, and actual contact mirror counts

### Added
- **Campaign engine all 13 channels** — Backend `CampaignEngine` expanded from 4 channels (email/sms/linkedin/multi) to all 13. Social channels route through GHL Social queue, call channels create agent call tasks, direct mail/webform/chat/event queue for external fulfillment. All channels record `platformResults` for tracking

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Campaign Flow Builder** — New visual tab in Campaign Studio for building cross-channel sequences. Add steps from any of 13 channels, reorder with up/down arrows, configure delays between steps, compose per-channel messages (email subjects, call scripts, social captions), and launch as a unified omnichannel sequence
- **Platform data mirror** — Backups page now shows live platform data mirror status for GHL, SMS-iT, and Dripify with auto-sync indicators. Data continuity messaging confirms local mirror is always active for disaster recovery

### Added
- **Cross-channel pattern analysis** — AI engine identifies 5 key cross-channel patterns (LinkedIn→Email, Email→Call, Multi-Touch Social, Event→Follow-Up, SMS Urgency) with conversion lift metrics (2.5x-5x), confidence scores, and suggested channel sequences
- **Channel synergy scoring** — 6 channel synergy pairs with 0-100 scores analyzing complementary channel combinations (Webform+Email: 90, Email+LinkedIn: 85, Email+Call: 80, etc.)
- **AI cross-channel recommendations** — Engine detects when campaigns use fewer than 3 channels and recommends multi-channel expansion with expected conversion improvements
- **Visual sequence flows** — Cross-channel patterns display suggested channel sequences with icons and arrows for intuitive understanding
